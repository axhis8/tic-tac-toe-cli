## About this Project

This is my first Python AI project. It feels really rewarding accomplishing it & I'm more than excited to continue!

This project is a personal milestone to understand complex algorithms and clean code structures. It features an implementation of the Minimax algorithm to create an unbeatable AI.

Please don't mind the excessive comments on the code, I did this project solely with my research, without watching a tutorial. So I wanted to document everything that which I didn't know, so in future I can look back and remember.

## Features

- Unbeatable AI using the Minimax algorithm
- Three difficulty levels (Easy, Middle, Impossible)
- Choice of player symbols (X/O)
- Input validation and error handling
- Modular code structure with Enums
- Console-based UI with board visualization
- Simulation of human moves by the AI

## How to Use

- Run the script via terminal: `python main.py`
- Choose your symbol (X or O)
- Select a difficulty level (1-3)
- Enter a position (1-9) to place your symbol on the board
- The game ends when a player wins or a draw occurs

## Built With

- Python 3
- Random module
- Enum module

## What I Learned

- Implementation of the Minimax algorithm
- Recursive function calls and state simulation
- Working with Python Enums for type safety
- Code modularization and file imports
- Using Static Methods and Class constants
- Advanced logic for game state evaluation
- Git branching and merging workflows
